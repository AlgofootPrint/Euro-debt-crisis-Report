# Euro-debt-crisis-Report using Power BI
A custom visual, chord chart was utilized in creating this visual, showing a chain of both creditors and debtors for various countries. 
Highlighting up to nine different countries which includes the united state, Japan, Ireland, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Greece, italy and Britian.

Three basic colors was used in this visual with different meanings refrencing the CSV data file. RED for High risk, GREY for Stable and YELLOW for Medium Risk.

While exploring the report i was able to highlight the highest debtor which was the United States and also the highest Creditor which was Japan. 

Thank you and Happy Analysing
